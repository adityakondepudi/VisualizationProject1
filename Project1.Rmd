## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



```{r}
#install.packages('GGally')
#install.packages('pheatmap')
#install.packages('funModeling')
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(GGally)
library(caret)
library(data.table)
library(ggpubr)
library(ROSE)
library(class)
library(pheatmap)
library(dplyr)
library(funModeling)

```

```{r}
#Reading the data
data <- read.csv("/Users/adityak/Documents/NEU/Coursework/Fall22/IE 6600 - Computation and Visualization/Project - 1/online_shoppers_intention.csv")
str(data)
#Structure of the data
```

```{r}
#Missing Value Analysis
sapply(data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
data <- na.omit(data)
str(data)
unique(data$Month)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#The column pairs BounceRates & ExitRates and ProductRelated & ProductRelated_Duration have 
#very high correlation as bounce rate refers to % of visitors who exit the page that they

#ProductRelated & ProductRelated_Duration are also highly correlated as both the columns deal

#From the first stacked bar chart, it can be observed the returning customers are almost 5 times 
#more than the new customers, the reason behind this could be that majority of the returning customers 
#who have already purchased a product, will dig deeper in the website for similar products and then 
#complete the transaction as opposed to new customers who don't have any shopping experience in the 
#website. Another reason could be some of the new customers may feel the registration process
#(entering name, email, address and card details) to be a tedious process. 
#From the first stacked bar chart, the revenue is higher on the weekends as compared to the weekdays. 
#The reason could be generally on weekends people tend to have more time to shop without any hurry 
#whereas on weekdays people are very busy majorly due to work and other reasons.

#We may infer that the customers who haven't made a purchase, have spent much more time than 
#the customers who have, this could be because the new customers might have had to spend time 
#on registration, account creation, feeding details, which as opposed to the existing customers, 
#would already have the details stored in the website and would just login to their account saving
#much more time.
# Similarly the false customers(who haven't made any purchase), have spent more time on informational 
#page than on the administrative page or product related page. This could be due to lack of experience 
#with the website and knowing more about the website page on the informational, which isn't the case 
#with the true customers, since they probably are pretty familiar with the website.
# False customers tend to spend more time on Product Related page, when compared to the true customers. 
#A valid reason could be, since a true customer has an intention to buy the product, they would spend 
#lesser time on the product related page, whereas the false customers tend to compare prices, read 
#more about the product in detail, or could be unsure about the decision whether to buy the product 
#or not, resulting in spending more time on the Product related page
